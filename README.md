# 🛡️ Privacy-Preserving Credit Card Fraud Detection 💳

Welcome to our Capstone Project — where **machine learning meets privacy** to combat credit card fraud without compromising sensitive data! 🧠🔒

---

## 📌 Overview

> **"Detect fraud like a pro — without peeking into private data."**

This project demonstrates a **privacy-preserving machine learning model** designed to identify fraudulent credit card transactions with high accuracy — while keeping personal data protected and secure.

We focus on blending **intelligent fraud detection** with **responsible data handling**, inspired by the growing need for ethical AI solutions in finance.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- ✅ Accurately detect fraudulent credit card transactions
- 🔐 Preserve user privacy using ethical ML practices
- 📉 Minimize false negatives (undetected fraud)
- ⚖️ Balance privacy and predictive performance

---

## 🔍 Dataset

We use the [Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) from Kaggle:

- 284,807 transactions, including **492 fraud cases**
- Anonymized features for customer privacy
- Highly imbalanced, requiring careful evaluation strategies

## 🧪 Techniques & Tools

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `NumPy`

### 🔍 Models Explored
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- (With potential for neural networks & ensemble methods)

### 🔐 Privacy Considerations
- Data anonymization
- Privacy-aware feature selection
- Minimal exposure of sensitive fields

> *Advanced techniques like Federated Learning & Differential Privacy are noted as future enhancements.*
